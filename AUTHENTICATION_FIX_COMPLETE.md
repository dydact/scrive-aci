# Authentication Fix Complete - Scrive ACI

## Summary
All authentication issues have been resolved. The system is now fully functional with proper user authentication.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Docker Configuration Issues
- **Fixed Apache DocumentRoot**: Changed from `/var/www/scrive-aci` to `/var/www/localhost/htdocs`
- **Fixed Port Mapping**: Changed from 8080/8443 to 80/443 for production
- **Removed Problematic Volume Mounts**: Commented out config and pages mounts that were overriding files

### 2. Database Configuration
- **Fixed Empty sqlconf.php**: Added proper database connection settings
- **Added Missing 'role' Column**: Ensured autism_users table has all required columns

### 3. Password Hash Issues
- **Web Context Fix**: Regenerated all password hashes in web context (not CLI)
- **Removed Hardcoded Credentials**: Removed hardcoded login from simple_login.php and openemr_integration.php

## Working Credentials

All users have been created and tested successfully:

### Executive/Admin Access (Level 5-6)
- **admin** / AdminPass123! - System Administrator
- **frank** / Supreme2024! - Supreme Administrator (Level 6)
- **mary.emah** / CEO2024! - Chief Executive Officer
- **drukpeh** / Executive2024! - Executive
- **alvin.ukpeh** / SysAdmin2024! - System Administrator

### Manager Access (Level 4)
- **amanda.georgi** / HR2024! - Human Resources Officer
- **edwin.recto** / Clinical2024! - Site Supervisor / Clinical Lead
- **pam.pastor** / Billing2024! - Billing Administrator
- **yanika.crosse** / Billing2024! - Billing Administrator

## Access URLs
- Main Site: http://aci.dydact.io/
- Staff Portal: http://staff.aci.dydact.io/
- Admin Portal: http://admin.aci.dydact.io/
- API Endpoint: http://api.aci.dydact.io/

## Verification Commands

To verify authentication is working:
```bash
# Test login locally
curl -s -X POST http://localhost/login -d "username=drukpeh&password=Executive2024!" -i

# Check user list in database
docker exec -it scrive-aci-iris-emr-1 mysql -u openemr -popenemr openemr -e "SELECT username, email, role, access_level FROM autism_users ORDER BY access_level DESC;"

# View container logs
docker-compose logs -f iris-emr
```

## Important Notes

1. **Do NOT recreate password hashes from CLI** - They won't work in web context
2. **Volume mounts in docker-compose.yml have been adjusted** - Don't revert these changes
3. **The sqlconf.php file must contain database credentials** - It was empty before
4. **Apache configuration uses aci-docker.conf** - Not the domain-specific one

## Next Steps

1. Monitor production site at aci.dydact.io for successful logins
2. Remove autism_waiver_app/simple_login.php if not needed
3. Consider implementing password reset functionality
4. Set up SSL certificates for production

## Troubleshooting

If authentication issues return:
1. Check SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md for correct paths
2. Verify sqlconf.php has database credentials
3. Ensure Apache DocumentRoot is /var/www/localhost/htdocs
4. Check that password hashes were created in web context
5. Review docker-compose logs for errors
