# Fixes Applied to Scrive ACI System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Billing Integration Page ✅
**Problem**: Undefined array keys causing warnings
- Line 367: "paid_this_month"
- Line 369: "collected_this_month" 
- Line 372: "outstanding_receivables"

**Fix Applied**: Added null coalescing operators (?? 0) to provide default values when keys don't exist

### 2. Schedule Manager Page ✅
**Problem**: Database error - "Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'status'"

**Fix Applied**: Removed WHERE status = 'active' clauses from queries for:
- autism_staff_members table
- autism_clients table

### 3. Client Management Page ✅
**Problem**: View, Edit, and Add Note buttons not working

**Fix Applied**: Changed relative paths to absolute paths:
- `client_detail.php` → `/autism_waiver_app/client_detail.php`
- `new_session.php` → `/autism_waiver_app/new_session.php`
- `add_client.php` → `/autism_waiver_app/add_client.php`

### 4. Reports Page ✅
**Problem 1**: Misleading "Coming Soon" message about database initialization

**Fix Applied**: Removed the entire alert message that suggested the database wasn't initialized

**Problem 2**: Database queries using non-existent columns:
- autism_clients: 'status' and 'enrollment_date' columns
- autism_session_notes table (doesn't exist)
- autism_staff_members: 'status' column

**Fix Applied**: Updated queries to use existing columns:
- Removed status checks, using COUNT(*) for all records
- Changed enrollment_date to created_at
- Changed autism_session_notes to autism_sessions
- Changed approved status check to completed
- Changed time calculation to use duration_hours column

## NOT Changed

### Reports Page Styling
The reports page maintains its original styling with Bootstrap and gradient headers, which appears to be the preferred "old styling" mentioned by the user. This styling was preserved and not modified.

## Summary

All critical errors have been fixed:
- ✅ No more undefined array key warnings on billing page
- ✅ No more database errors on schedule manager
- ✅ Client management buttons now work properly
- ✅ Reports page no longer shows misleading messages
- ✅ Reports page queries work with actual database schema
- ✅ Original styling preserved where it was working

The system should now function without the reported errors.
