# Scrive ACI Billing System Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The Scrive ACI autism waiver application has basic billing functionality implemented but **lacks critical features required for commercial healthcare billing operations**. While it has foundational components like claims creation and basic EDI structure, it is missing essential revenue cycle management features, compliance requirements, and operational tools needed for real-world Medicaid billing.

## Current Billing Components

### 1. Database Structure

**Implemented Tables:**
- `autism_claims` - Basic claim storage (simplified structure)
- `autism_billing_entries` - Links time tracking to billing
- `autism_time_clock` - Employee time tracking
- `autism_payroll_summary` - Payroll aggregation

**Advanced Tables (in SQL schemas but not confirmed as deployed):**
- `autism_insurance_info` - Insurance management
- `autism_prior_authorizations` - Authorization tracking
- `autism_edi_transactions` - EDI processing
- `autism_claim_lines` - Detailed claim lines
- `autism_payments` - Payment processing
- `autism_payment_plans` - Payment arrangements

### 2. Current Features

**✅ Implemented:**
- Basic claim creation and management
- Simple claim status tracking (draft, generated, submitted, paid, denied)
- Time clock integration with billing
- Basic payroll reporting
- Rudimentary EDI 837 file generation structure
- Simple billing dashboard with statistics

**❌ Missing Critical Features:**

### 3. Essential Missing Components for Commercial Use

#### A. Claims Processing & Submission
- **No real EDI 837 implementation** - Current code has placeholder structure only
- **No claim validation** before submission
- **No batch claim processing**
- **No claim scrubbing** for errors
- **No electronic submission gateway** integration
- **No claim status inquiry** (276/277 transactions)
- **No resubmission workflow** for corrected claims

#### B. Payment & Remittance Processing
- **No EDI 835 remittance processing** - Code exists but not implemented
- **No payment posting automation**
- **No ERA (Electronic Remittance Advice) parsing**
- **No payment reconciliation**
- **No adjustment reason code handling**
- **No patient balance calculation**
- **No secondary/tertiary payer cascading**

#### C. Revenue Cycle Management
- **No aging reports** (though SQL view exists)
- **No collection workflows**
- **No denial management system**
- **No appeal tracking**
- **No write-off management**
- **No bad debt tracking**
- **No financial reporting dashboards**

#### D. Authorization & Eligibility
- **No real-time eligibility verification** (270/271)
- **No authorization tracking integration**
- **No authorization expiration alerts**
- **No units remaining tracking**
- **No auth requirement validation**

#### E. Compliance & Audit
- **No audit trail for billing changes**
- **No HIPAA transaction logging**
- **No claim attachment support**
- **No documentation requirements validation**
- **No timely filing tracking**
- **No compliance reporting**

#### F. Operational Features
- **No billing queue management**
- **No productivity tracking**
- **No claim follow-up workflows**
- **No billing exception handling**

### 4. Maryland Medicaid Specific Requirements

**Missing:**
- Specific Maryland Medicaid billing rules engine
- DDA (Developmental Disabilities Administration) specific validations
- Maryland-specific service codes and modifiers
- CFC (Community First Choice) billing requirements
- Coordination of benefits with other Maryland programs
- Maryland-specific prior authorization workflows

### 5. Integration Gaps

**Missing Integrations:**
- No connection to Maryland Medicaid portal
- No clearinghouse integration
- No practice management system integration
- No QuickBooks/accounting software integration (mentioned but not implemented)
- No document management system
- No credit card processing
- No patient portal for statements

### 6. Security & Access Control

**Current:** Basic role-based access (1-5 levels)

**Missing:**
- Granular billing permissions
- PHI access logging for billing data
- Billing data encryption at rest
- Secure document storage for EOBs/remittances

### 7. Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clean UI design
- Basic MVC structure
- Role-based access foundation

**Weaknesses:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in billing_claims.php
- No input validation on claim amounts
- No CSRF protection
- Hardcoded values instead of configuration
- No error handling for payment processing
- No transaction management for financial operations

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Financial Accuracy** - No validation of billing amounts or calculations
2. **Compliance** - Missing audit trails and HIPAA compliance features
3. **Revenue Loss** - No denial management or follow-up workflows
4. **Security** - SQL injection vulnerabilities with financial data
5. **Operations** - No exception handling or error recovery

## Recommendations for Commercial Readiness

### Phase 1: Critical Foundation (2-3 months)
1. Implement proper EDI 837/835 processing with a real EDI library
2. Add comprehensive claim validation and scrubbing
3. Build payment posting and reconciliation
4. Create aging and collection workflows
5. Fix security vulnerabilities

### Phase 2: Operational Excellence (2-3 months)
1. Implement authorization tracking and validation
2. Build denial management system
3. Create billing queue and workflow management
4. Add compliance reporting
5. Implement audit trails

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 months)
1. Clearinghouse integration
2. Real-time eligibility checking
3. Automated payment posting
4. Advanced analytics and KPI dashboards
5. Patient payment portal

### Phase 4: Maryland Specific (1-2 months)
1. Maryland Medicaid specific rules engine
2. DDA billing requirements
3. State-specific reporting
4. Maryland provider portal integration

## Estimated Timeline & Resources

**Total Timeline:** 8-12 months for full commercial readiness

**Required Resources:**
- 2-3 Senior healthcare developers familiar with medical billing
- 1 Healthcare billing domain expert
- 1 Compliance/regulatory expert
- 1 Security engineer
- EDI processing library/service
- Clearinghouse partnership
- Extensive testing with real Maryland Medicaid claims

## Conclusion

The current Scrive ACI billing system provides a basic foundation but requires substantial development before it can handle real-world healthcare billing operations. The system lacks critical revenue cycle management features, compliance tools, and the robustness required for managing Medicaid billing in a production environment.

**Current State:** Proof of concept / Early prototype
**Commercial Readiness:** 20-25% complete
**Recommendation:** Significant additional development required before production use

The highest priorities should be:
1. Implementing real EDI processing
2. Building payment and remittance handling
3. Creating denial and workflow management
4. Ensuring compliance and security
5. Adding Maryland Medicaid specific features
